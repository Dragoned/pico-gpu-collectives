## TODOS
List of #TODO for the plotting module:
- restructure the reading of the data such that it does not need anymore the summarize data.
- summarize data should be a "what if I want to send those summary to someone"
- the cli shold allow and guide me in the selection of the graph and the data for that graph. Will require some work
  - as of now it is only an entrypoint to various subscript to rewrite
- there needs to be a documentation for the plotting script
- all that is written here will be completely deleted and restructured in the future
- a tui will be written sooner or later
